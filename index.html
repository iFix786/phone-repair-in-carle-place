Everyone I went to either would say it’s not fixable or try to sell me another phone. He wasn’t wrong Nora saw the phone and assured me she could fix it and she did. Great customer service very friendly and quick repair she had the screen protector too which was really convenient since a lot of people don’t  have it.

Screen Repair in Carle Place

<p>


Battery Replacement in Carle Place
You've probably noticed that as your Phone gets older, the battery starts to discharge more quickly. <p>Usually, you need to connect the Phone to the charger when you first get it. <p>But the battery life gets less the more you use it and the older it gets. <p>When this occurs, many people quickly buy a new phone without considering other options like phone battery replacement. <p>The cost of replacing the Phone battery is much less expensive at the correct local cell phone repair shop than throwing away your old Phone and purchasing a new one.
<p>
Just walk into or call your local iFixScreens store in Carle Place to get your Phone's lowest battery replacement cost. <p>We also provide you with a 180-day warranty to keep you covered.
<p>

If you have a cell phone with broken back glass, it can be embarrassing and impact the functionality of your camera and basic operations. <p>In many ways, it is like having a crack in your windshield – at some point, you know it will need to be fixed.
<p>
Fortunately, the technicians at iFixScreens can handle any back glass repair needed on your Phone. <p>Since the iPhone first added glass to its back cover, we have been conducting back glass replacement repairs on cell phones for our Carle Place customers. <p>We can ensure it is fixed right the first time. <p>Walk to our iFixScreens Store in Carle Place or call (855) 462-4349 to book an appointment. <p>


Charging Port Repair in Carle Place
A damaged charging port is among the most complicated issues requiring repair. <p>This won't occur unless some external force has been applied to it, causing the port to break or disconnect from the root connection physically. <p>Usually, this happens as a result of someone shoving a charging cord into the port. <p>You will, unfortunately, need to take your phone to a repair shop to get the charging port fixed due to this complicated issue. <p>To replace the port, a professional will need to open your Phone. <p>Visit the iFixScreens store in Carle Place for the fastest turnaround time and affordable charging port repairs.
<p>
